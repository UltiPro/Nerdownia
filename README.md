# Nerdownia
Nerdownia created by Patryk 'UltiPro' WÃ³jtowicz using PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

This is the first project I ever developed. It was a physical server on which game servers were located, such as: Minecraft, CS:GO, SCP, etc. An authorization and authentication system was implemented to manage them. In addition, simple javascript games have been implemented
